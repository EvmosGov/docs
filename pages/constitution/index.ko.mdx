# The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO

## 선 언 문

우리 Evmos 커뮤니티는 Evmos 네트워크를 구축하고 성장시키는 데 도움을 주기 위한 우리의 공통된 신념과 사명을 공식적으로 선언한다. 우리는 Cosmos SDK 모듈, Tendermint의 컨센서스 엔진 및 완전히 분산된 검열 방지 상호 운용 가능한 체인을 위한 Inter Blockchain Protocol을 활용하여 Cosmos 생태계에서 선도적인 EVM 네트워크가 되기 위해 노력한다. Evmos 네트워크, 우리 커뮤니티 및 우리의 거버넌스 프로세스는 보다 평등하고 초연결적이며 분산된 미래를 위한 토대를 마련하는 역할을 하기 위해 노력해야 한다.

## 1. EVMOS 커뮤니티

Evmos 커뮤니티(이하 “커뮤니티")는 Evmos 네트워크에 참여하는 다양한 그룹을 포함하는 포괄적인 용어이다. 참여 수준과 정도는 그룹마다 다를 수 있지만, 커뮤니티의 모든 구성원은 함께 Evmos 네트워크의 지속적인 성장에 관심을 기울이고 노력해야한다.

**1. Protocol Developers** - this group of developers focuses mainly on improving the Evmos network on the protocol level; this group includes core developers as well as individual contributors not considered as core team members.

**2. Network Validators** - network validators are key members of the community responsible for securing the network through the Tendermint proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. 

**3. Network Delegators** - network delegators are the predominant group that assist in network consensus and security by delegating power to validators through the staking of tokens.

**4. Workstream and Committee Members** - workstream and committee members are those that work to improve and grow the Evmos network on a non-protocol level. 

**5. Community Leaders** - workstreams and special projects, although not required, may have an appointed leader to steward and lead his or her group.

**6. Application Developers and End Users** - application developers and end users are those that develop, deploy, utilize, interact, transact, and ultimately bring value to the Evmos ecosystem.  

While the aforementioned groups make up the majority of the community, the definition and composition of the community are not strictly limited to these groups.

## 2. The Evmos Governance Framework

The Evmos Governance Framework (“framework”) is the foundational set of guidelines and processes developed for the community and network contributors to follow and flourish. The framework should be designed to recognize and incentivize contributors and curate a culture that creates long-term, positive-sum interactions between all community members and the Evmos ecosystem.

The framework is to be proposed and adopted separately from the Constitution. The Constitution shall take priority over the Governance Framework and should be regarded as the supreme guiding document. 

## 3. Guiding Principles and Values

**1. Progressive Decentralization:** The Evmos network aims to be as decentralized as possible, in the context of network validation as well as governance and finances. While network resiliency and the decentralization of power is paramount, we recognize the need to proceed with strategic and scientific-based planning. The community must not haphazardly rush into decisions that may potentially destabilize the chain or provoke a strong negative community reaction. The community will take the stance of progressive decentralization as we research and analyze the social, legal, and/or financial ramifications our decisions may potential have. 

**2. Neutrality and Non-Partisanship:** We believe in the principles of equality for all and must act in accordance with this core principle. All groups and community members have equal access to information, equal rights, and equal responsibilities, as defined by this Constitution. No one group or community member should be favored over any other members. No one group or community member should be disfavored over any other members. We define “favor” as an unfair benefit that is not a direct consequence of provable effort and actions done, in alignment with our mission and goals. We define “disfavor” as an unfair punishment or loss of opportunity that is not a direct consequence of provable actions done against Evmos’ mission and goals.

**3. User-Centrism:** Evmos is specialized to provide a unique EVM experience in the Cosmos ecosystem. We must therefore continue to optimize for 1) user adoption and 2) the qualities that contribute to steady growth: network liquidity, improvement of user experience, data sovereignty, stable production of blocks, educational resources, strong governance, etc.

**4. Agnosticism:** Evmos should maintain neutrality as a chain with roots in both the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. While the governance of Evmos may be reliant from time to time on other networks or tools, the Evmos community should retain a stance of neutrality. Community members must leave tribalism at the door; we should refrain from engaging in political debates that are not directly relevant to improving the Evmos network.

**5. Cross-Chain Diplomacy:** Evmos is a network with a long history in the decentralization movement, with inspirations, ideas, protocols, and allies in various networks. Our community will come from a wide range of blockchain communities. Cross-chain collaborations, outreach initiatives, diplomacy missions, and continued participation in events are highly encouraged — especially with chains from the EVM and IBC ecosystems. 

**6. Consensual Collaboration:** While the Cosmos SDK’s implementation of governance is relatively permissionless, this does not mean anyone is entitled to work or compensation. Proposals will be assessed by the community on their merits alone and eventually voted on. In addition, proposals must follow the Governance Framework of the Evmos network and adhere to the principles outlined in the Constitution.

**7. Sovereignty to Work:** The purpose of the Governance Framework is not to micro-manage proposals or teams. Sovereignty will be given to those that are working in accordance with the original proposal passed by the community, and are not in violation of any governance processes or principles of the Constitution. 

## 4. Removal of Community Leaders

All community members appointed to a role of higher responsibility, including workstream members, may be removed via a formal vote on-chain. The Governance Framework shall outline the appointment, removal, and appeals process, along with a detailed dispute resolution guideline.

## 5. Constitutional Rights

Constitutional rights protect the members of the community from any unjust or cruel treatment by another member or the DAO itself. The Governance workstream shall amend a Bill of Rights to the Constitution as soon as a general consensus can be confidently reached.

## 6. Constitutional Amendments and Revisions

The community holds the power to propose an amendment to the Constitution by following the standard Evmos Proposal Lifecycle. The reasoning for the amendment must be justified and petitioned. If possible, there should be an attempt made to resolve the issue before a proposal for amendment is initiated.

**Validator/Community Code of Conduct and Constitutional Rights**

We recognize that this Constitution is missing a few key topics — however, we also see the need to tread carefully in these sensitive and controversial topics. While it is inarguable that these are necessary components of the Constitution, there was clear signaling that we needed more time to allow for the natural growth of the community before we could formally ratify some sections with confidence. We pledge to continue our research and continue to engage with the community to find general consensus on the best step forward. 

While some topics will be amended into the Constitution when they are ready, most will likely be implemented through the Governance Framework.
